00:00:01.777 -> 00:00:04.033
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

2
00:00:04.033 -> 00:00:05.992
Catch a tiger by the toe

3
00:00:05.992 -> 00:00:08.056
If he hollers let him go

4
00:00:08.056 -> 00:00:10.962
Eeny, meeny, miny moe.

5
00:00:12.710 -> 00:00:14.644
I'm Jutta Treviranus

6
00:00:14.644 -> 00:00:16.041
and I've come to wonder

7
00:00:16.041 -> 00:00:18.387
whether we have a chance to reorganize our future.

8
00:00:18.387 -> 00:00:23.231
David Kelley says that the future of design is human centred.

9
00:00:23.231 -> 00:00:25.513
Most experts agree.

10
00:00:25.513 -> 00:00:29.029
That leaves the question - which human?

11
00:00:29.029 -> 00:00:32.464
An inevitable human condition is diversity.

12
00:00:32.464 -> 00:00:34.706
There's no typical human,

13
00:00:34.706 -> 00:00:37.331
even clones and identical twins are not the same.

14
00:00:37.331 -> 00:00:40.421
We differ from one to the next,

15
00:00:40.421 -> 00:00:43.546
but also from one moment to the next,

16
00:00:43.546 -> 00:00:46.842
from one context to the next.

17
00:00:46.842 -> 00:00:49.912
But diversity and difference become overwhelming

18
00:00:49.912 -> 00:00:52.948
and we develop strategies to deal with this diversity.

19
00:00:52.948 -> 00:00:55.569
We try to make things simpler,

20
00:00:55.600 -> 00:00:57.500
less complex, less chaotic

21
00:00:57.500 -> 00:01:00.864
Another part of the human condition is that

22
00:01:00.864 -> 00:01:03.185
we try to find commonality and connections.

23
00:01:03.200 -> 00:01:09.538
We form groups informal and formal with implicit and explicit criteria.

24
00:01:09.554 -> 00:01:13.979
We organize, we create categories, we filter, we label.

25
00:01:13.979 -> 00:01:19.679
At our most insecure and overwhelmed we divide in two, we create binaries:

26
00:01:19.679 -> 00:01:21.867
male, female

27
00:01:21.867 -> 00:01:24.215
disabled, normal

28
00:01:24.215 -> 00:01:27.031
left, right

29
00:01:27.031 -> 00:01:29.579
us, them.

30
00:01:29.579 -> 00:01:34.982
This all results in issues of who belongs and who is excluded.

31
00:01:34.982 -> 00:01:37.536
Membership in groups can be self assigned,

32
00:01:37.536 -> 00:01:40.467
may be imposed, may even be policed.

33
00:01:40.467 -> 00:01:44.179
Groups are used to assert or assign privileges and powers.

34
00:01:44.179 -> 00:01:46.929
We use groups to judge

35
00:01:46.929 -> 00:01:49.225
values get assigned to groups

36
00:01:49.225 -> 00:01:51.887
often characteristics that have nothing to do with

37
00:01:51.887 -> 00:01:53.356
the original founding properties of groups

38
00:01:53.356 -> 00:01:55.982
are generalized to all individuals in the group.

39
00:01:55.982 -> 00:02:00.071
Sometimes, people who are in an imposed group

40
00:02:00.071 -> 00:02:02.831
take ownership of the group and reform

41
00:02:02.831 -> 00:02:04.423
the classifications and values from within.

42
00:02:04.423 -> 00:02:08.446
Occasionally, someone has the audacity

43
00:02:08.446 -> 00:02:11.746
to break out of the category we have put her in

44
00:02:11.746 -> 00:02:16.910
but to preserve our category, we may dismiss her as an anomaly.

45
00:02:16.910 -> 00:02:20.031
Some groups are more fluid while others are more fixed.

46
00:02:20.031 -> 00:02:23.561
We not only form groups, but groups of groups

47
00:02:23.561 -> 00:02:25.662
and groups, of groups, of groups.

48
00:02:25.662 -> 00:02:29.100
Membership in one group can grant us membership in other groups.

49
00:02:29.100 -> 00:02:33.036
But despite all this, we are diverse,

50
00:02:33.036 -> 00:02:34.859
we are complex,

51
00:02:34.859 -> 00:02:36.452
we are chaotic.

52
00:02:36.452 -> 00:02:38.818
Individually we're different

53
00:02:38.818 -> 00:02:40.441
over time, in different contexts,

54
00:02:40.441 -> 00:02:42.356
in different roles, in different groups.

55
00:02:42.356 -> 00:02:45.429
We need to assert our uniqueness,

56
00:02:45.429 -> 00:02:47.864
we need to form and refine our identity.

57
00:02:47.864 -> 00:02:50.914
We struggle with the identity imposed on us.

58
00:02:50.914 -> 00:02:56.367
Generally, people do not fit easily into assigned categories

59
00:02:56.367 -> 00:02:58.982
and yet we persist in assigning them.

60
00:02:58.982 -> 00:03:02.631
And then, something new comes along

61
00:03:02.631 -> 00:03:05.415
and shakes up our groups, our categories and our rules,

62
00:03:05.415 -> 00:03:08.266
and we need to adjust, rebuild and rethink.

63
00:03:08.266 -> 00:03:12.533
Something like, networks and digital stuff.

64
00:03:12.533 -> 00:03:15.471
This new digital and connected world

65
00:03:15.471 -> 00:03:17.875
puts into question how we group things

66
00:03:17.875 -> 00:03:20.759
and challenges our excuses for leaving people out.

67
00:03:20.759 -> 00:03:25.469
The digital changes our view of time, space and distance

68
00:03:25.469 -> 00:03:31.085
and by extension our view of design, what is possible and what things cost.

69
00:03:31.085 -> 00:03:36.048
Digital things are plastic, mutable, malleable and adaptable.

70
00:03:36.048 -> 00:03:39.500
Before, not everyone could fit,

71
00:03:39.500 -> 00:03:42.167
allowing someone in meant someone else was left out.

72
00:03:42.167 -> 00:03:46.067
In the digital, room is very stretchy.

73
00:03:46.067 -> 00:03:49.767
Before, what we created could not fit everyone

74
00:03:49.767 -> 00:03:51.777
so we made it fit the largest group.

75
00:03:51.777 -> 00:03:54.533
We made it for the group called average or typical

76
00:03:54.533 -> 00:03:58.267
this left out everyone not average or typical.

77
00:03:58.267 -> 00:04:03.399
In the digital reality the things we make can reconfigure, adapt

78
00:04:03.399 -> 00:04:06.274
and take a form that is best for each individual.

79
00:04:06.274 -> 00:04:11.900
In the solid world, each copy cost almost the same as the original.

80
00:04:11.900 -> 00:04:14.351
Consumption actually consumed.

81
00:04:14.351 -> 00:04:18.567
In the digital world, we can copy almost without cost.

82
00:04:18.567 -> 00:04:21.000
Consumption no longer consumes.

83
00:04:21.000 -> 00:04:24.522
Before, it took a great deal of time and effort

84
00:04:24.522 -> 00:04:27.233
to deliver things, especially to people far away.

85
00:04:27.233 -> 00:04:30.933
Now it is as easy to deliver things around the world

86
00:04:30.933 -> 00:04:33.133
as it is to deliver things next door.

87
00:04:33.133 -> 00:04:36.852
Before, if we didn't place things in a fixed spot

88
00:04:36.852 -> 00:04:39.533
we would have a hard time finding them again.

89
00:04:39.533 -> 00:04:43.633
Now we can place them anywhere on the network and

90
00:04:43.633 -> 00:04:46.267
retrieve them anywhere on the network.

91
00:04:46.267 -> 00:04:50.133
Before, we needed to label things unambiguously and simply

92
00:04:50.133 -> 00:04:52.800
so we could recognize them and know what to do with them.

93
00:04:52.800 -> 00:04:56.449
Now we can see a description of each person or thing

94
00:04:56.449 -> 00:04:59.027
that is useful and relevant to our purpose.

95
00:04:59.027 -> 00:05:03.020
And by the way, we have learned that

96
00:05:03.020 -> 00:05:06.367
inclusion and equality are good for all of us.

97
00:05:06.367 -> 00:05:09.359
We are all healthier, wealthier and wiser

98
00:05:09.359 -> 00:05:12.200
when our society is inclusive and equal.

99
00:05:12.200 -> 00:05:15.367
We've also discovered that diverse groups

100
00:05:15.367 -> 00:05:18.936
are more innovative and creative, and better at planning and predicting.

101
00:05:18.936 -> 00:05:23.733
We've experimented with new organization like

102
00:05:23.733 -> 00:05:26.333
most popular, to be ignored

103
00:05:26.333 -> 00:05:28.700
friend, not friend.

104
00:05:28.700 -> 00:05:31.033
But we can do better.

105
00:05:31.033 -> 00:05:33.267
We can afford to be generous in our design,

106
00:05:33.267 -> 00:05:35.400
we have fewer excuses to exclude.

107
00:05:35.400 -> 00:05:37.567
We can be true to our diversity.

108
00:05:37.567 -> 00:05:43.067
Perhaps now, we can find a way to make room for us all.
