1
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,184
Jemaine, who am I?

2
00:00:35,252 --> 00:00:37,587
- "Do it now!"
- Your mom.

3
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:40,490
Okay, who am I?
"Oh, hello, Bret."

4
00:00:40,557 --> 00:00:42,258
- That's my mom.
- Oh yeah.

5
00:00:42,326 --> 00:00:45,061
Okay, who's this?
Aaah!

6
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:47,297
Aaah.

7
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:48,932
Victoria.

8
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:51,067
- Victoria?
- Victoria, yeah.

9
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,369
- Victoria who?
- Bartosh.

10
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:54,837
Oh, yes.
That sounds like her.

11
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:56,773
Who am I this time?

12
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,242
<i>- Charlie!</i>
- Who's that?

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,111
- Charlie! Charlie!
- Oh. Oh.

14
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:05,448
I've got a cramp.

15
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:07,850
You guys haven't seen a dog
running through here, have you?

16
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:09,385
- A dog?
- What kind of dog is it?

17
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:12,055
It's a yorkshire terrier.
His name's Charlie.

18
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:14,791
- Just a four-legged kind of... -
he can't have gone far. On foot?

19
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,293
Yes, we had a disagreement
and he ran out.

20
00:01:17,361 --> 00:01:19,662
I'm just really worried.
He has canine epilepsy.

21
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,097
- Terrible affliction.
- Poor Charlie.

22
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:22,231
I'm Barbara, by the way.

23
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,466
- Jemaine.
- Bret.

24
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:25,902
Great. Well, if you see him,
I'll be walking around.

25
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,738
- So, um, thanks.
- Yeah, okay.

26
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:31,674
Thank you very much.
Okay, bye.

82
00:03:28,892 --> 00:03:30,493
¶ she had her eye
on my knee ¶

83
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:33,329
¶ dawg, I'm sorry, she
had her eye on my guns ¶

84
00:03:33,397 --> 00:03:36,466
¶ oh, you're loco, she
was checking out my buns ¶

85
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,801
¶ no, bro, she had
an eye on me ¶

86
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,737
¶ she had an eye on me ¶

87
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,472
¶ how could she have
an eye on both of us? ¶

88
00:03:42,573 --> 00:03:45,275
¶ wait a minute, you talking
about the girl with the lazy eye? ¶

89
00:03:45,342 --> 00:03:48,678
¶ I think she might have
had a slightly lazy eye ¶

90
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:53,249
¶ we're both in love with the sexy
lady with the eye that's lazy ¶

- ¶ yeah yeah ¶
- ¶ yeah yeah ¶

95
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:05,128
¶ we're both in love with the sexy
lady with the eye that's lazy ¶

96
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:07,430
¶ the girl that's fly
with the wonky eye... ¶

97
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:13,002
no no, that's not him.

98
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,737
- What about this one?
- No.

99
00:04:14,805 --> 00:04:16,806
- What about this one here? Charlie.
- No.

100
00:04:16,874 --> 00:04:18,641
You see this one?
He seems to recognize you.

101
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,643
Nope, that's not him.

102
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,278
<i>That's him.</i>
No? It's not him?

103
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,080
- None of these are him.
- You don't want these ones?

104
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:26,115
You know what? If I
don't find Charlie or...

105
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,517
you can have
all of these ones.

106
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,453
You guys are so sweet.
Thank you so much.

107
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,988
<i>- No problem.</i>
- Where did you get all these dogs?

108
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:34,223
- Just people had them.
- These are just lost terriers.

109
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,825
<i>- Oh.</i>
- So I grabbed them.

110
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:38,328
- I thought, "oh, they might be Charlie."
- I just got these.

111
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:41,030
<i>- Right. Thank you, to both of you.</i>
- Just helping you out.

112
00:04:41,098 --> 00:04:43,800
- Oh, I ha a picture of ch.
- That would help, yeah.

113
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,135
- That's Charlie.
- Oh, cute.

114
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:49,439
All right, so he's more
of a cat than a dog.

115
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,140
No no.

116
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,210
He's in a kitten costume.
It was for a party.

117
00:04:54,278 --> 00:04:56,879
<i>- Oh right, a halloween party.</i>
- That's really cute.

118
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:58,615
No, it was a kitten party.

119
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:00,717
<i>They didn't allow dogs.</i>

120
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,452
You dressed your dog
as a cat?

121
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,787
Yeah, no dogs allowed, so it was
the only way I could sneak him in.

122
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:07,023
- It's a great disguise
- thanks.

123
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:09,058
Oh, you know what? Let me give
you my number just in case.

124
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,827
- That would be great.
- Is that okay?

125
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,829
- We'll grab some dinner or something.
- Great.

126
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,865
- Just call me anytime.
- Yeah, okay.

127
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,100
- Okay.
- Great to see you.

128
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,469
- Thanks, bye.
- See ya.

129
00:05:26,877 --> 00:05:29,145
<i>All right, just some</i>
notes from the last gig.

130
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:31,848
- Jemaine, you had great stage presence.
- Thank you.

131
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,917
Fantastic.
Bret...

132
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:36,352
no stage presence,
unfortunately.

133
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,489
The last gig?
I didn't do that gig,

134
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:41,991
exactly. Okay, you've
got to turn up to the gig.

135
00:05:42,059 --> 00:05:43,693
Yeah, well, that's not
really stage presence.

136
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,529
- Where were you?
- I was at jazzercise.

137
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,865
- Jazzercise?
- I told you I couldn't come to that gig.

138
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:51,367
What are you organizing
your jazzercise events for

139
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,136
during gig times?

140
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:55,638
Yeah, that was a bit of a clash.
It doesn't normally happen.

141
00:05:55,706 --> 00:05:59,042
You should organize your
jazzercise for a different day.

142
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:01,878
Is it because you've already
paid for your membership

143
00:06:01,946 --> 00:06:03,780
and you've got these
classes sorted?

144
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:05,281
Yeah, I paid for five
and I got six classes.

145
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:07,383
And you've got to go to them? Okay.

146
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,886
- So why aren't you going to these classes?
- We had a gig, didn't we?

147
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,721
Of course.
That's why he's not there.

148
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,523
I know. It's a shame,
'cause he would love it.

149
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:14,958
It's a shame
that they clash,

150
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,526
because these classes
sound fun.

151
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:20,096
Okay, item two.
This is the final item here.

152
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:21,764
Song ideas.

153
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:23,733
- Yes, I've had a song idea.
- Oh, yes.

154
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:24,901
- Have you?
- I have, yup.

155
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,636
<i>- Both of you?</i>
- Yes.

156
00:06:26,704 --> 00:06:28,538
Wow. That time
of the year again.

157
00:06:28,606 --> 00:06:31,474
Let's have a look.
Now two years ago

158
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:34,944
we had Jemaine... forest.
You had a forest idea.

159
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,980
- Don't remember.
- And Bret...

160
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:39,282
- "I wish I was a tree."
- Yeah, still working on that.

161
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,217
Quite similar to
the forest idea.

162
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:44,120
And then last year sailing
from you, Jemaine.

163
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:45,555
No, still finishing
that one.

164
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:47,957
Yeah? It's been
nearly a year now.

165
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:49,926
- Well, I don't know anything about sailing.
- Okay.

166
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:51,327
Bret, nothing
from you last year.

167
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,795
<i>- I didn't do much last year.</i>
- Yeah?

168
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:55,164
It's good to have you back
onboard this year with an idea.

169
00:06:55,232 --> 00:06:57,500
- So what is it?
- It's a song about...

170
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,068
pepileptic dogs.

171
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,937
- Epileptic dogs.
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,339
Okay.

173
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:06,776
Mine's about dogs
with epilepsy.

174
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,178
So you're both writing songs
about epileptic dogs?

175
00:07:09,246 --> 00:07:11,114
Well, either way
you look at it

176
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,116
it's quite a complicated
subject, isn't it?

177
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,018
- Well, it's... - why don't
you stick to your sailing idea?

178
00:07:15,085 --> 00:07:17,820
- Yeah.
- By the way, if you're gonna have two songs this year,

179
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:20,823
which is great, why don't you
have two different songs?

180
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:23,660
You've got
epileptic dogs, Bret,

181
00:07:23,727 --> 00:07:25,528
why don't you try
something different?

182
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:27,463
- Well, because...
- how about sailing dogs?

183
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,998
This is something
I care about.

184
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,767
- I want to get this message out there.
- Risky.

185
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,535
Just to let you know,
the top bands,

186
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:35,471
they have their songs here and
their political messages over here.

187
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,273
Okay?
Not together.

188
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:39,609
'Cause then you'll end up
alienating half your fan base.

189
00:07:39,677 --> 00:07:42,011
Yeah, but we're trying
to raise awareness

190
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,713
for these poor
epileptic dogs.

191
00:07:43,814 --> 00:07:46,049
My point is, if you were
to say record a song

192
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:48,618
that was anti-aids,
for example,

193
00:07:48,686 --> 00:07:51,287
then you'd end up alienating all
those people that are pro-aids.

194
00:07:51,355 --> 00:07:53,323
How many people do you
know who are pro-aids?

195
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,624
No one's pro-aids.

196
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:57,193
Greg, just a quick
question, please.

197
00:07:57,261 --> 00:08:00,229
Greg, are you pro
or anti-aids?

198
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:01,831
<i>- Anti.</i>
- Anti?

199
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:04,067
Okay, can you do a quick
whiz around the office

200
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,568
and just see
if anyone's pro?

201
00:08:05,636 --> 00:08:08,705
All right, do you want
me to... anybody pro-aids?

202
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:10,640
I think you'll find most
people are anti-aids.

203
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:13,343
Well, he's... that's one.
One for anti.

204
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,579
- What would you be?
- I would be anti-aids.

205
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:18,348
Okay. You'd be pro, would you?

206
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,916
<i>- I'm anti.</i>
- You're anti?

207
00:08:19,984 --> 00:08:22,485
Well, we don't have time
to do a proper survey now.

208
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:24,487
Let's not get all
bogged down on aids.

209
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:27,090
- What were we talking about?
- Epileptic dogs.

210
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,025
- Oh yeah, right.
- A charity recording.

211
00:08:29,093 --> 00:08:31,160
Well, if toby ever had
that, I'd like to think

212
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:33,129
that I tried my best for him. You know?

213
00:08:33,197 --> 00:08:35,665
So maybe we should do this.
Yeah?

214
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:37,700
- Yes. Let's do it.
- Let's do it to it.

215
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,038
¶ there's a dog
named Charlie ¶

216
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:44,941
¶ a little lady
who missed him ¶

217
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:47,210
¶ Charlie had
a little disorder ¶

218
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:50,446
¶ of his nervous system,
talking about the thyroid ¶

219
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:52,515
¶ ooh... ¶

220
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,985
¶ if your little dog's
problems continue to persist ¶

221
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:59,355
¶ then you may wish to see
a canine neurologist ¶

222
00:08:59,423 --> 00:09:01,624
¶ I'm talking about
canine pepilepsy... ¶

223
00:09:04,428 --> 00:09:06,663
hello, Bret speaking.

224
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,232
Hey, brahbrah.
Thanks for calling back.

225
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,167
Yeah, I was just wondering
if you might like

226
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:13,202
to grab dinner sometime.

227
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,139
Okay, tonight?
7:00?

228
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:18,207
Cool. Okay.

229
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:20,209
Yes.

230
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:25,081
Barbara, oh, hello.

231
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,451
Yeah, I was wondering if you'd
like to get dinner around 7:00.

232
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:30,386
Oh, really?

233
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:32,121
What are you doing?

234
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,725
Could you get out of it?

235
00:09:35,793 --> 00:09:38,261
How about 8:00?
That's perfect.

236
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,829
What about 7:30?
Okay, 8:00.

237
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:42,498
All right.
Bye.

238
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,637
I brought some photos
like I said I would.

239
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,372
This is Charlie in his
cheerleading outfit.

240
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,240
Oh, that's cute.
Is he a good cheerleader?

241
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:54,277
He's great. He can make a
c and an I with his body.

242
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,312
- So you tell me.
- Sounds good.

243
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:58,982
Oh, and this is Charlie
in his pumpkin costume.

244
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,683
Halloween?

245
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:03,686
- No, it was for a gourd party.
- Good.

246
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:05,622
Um, this is, um...

247
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,991
that's his enemy.

248
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,693
- He has an enemy?
- Yes. I am trying to find him.

249
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:14,631
- He goes by the name of señor.
- I'll keep an eye out for him

250
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,833
- 'cause he could be an important lead.
- I'll find him.

251
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,701
Hey, brahbrah, did I tell you
that I've written you a song?

252
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:20,370
- No.
- I didn't?

253
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:22,105
Yes, for you
and also for Charlie.

254
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:23,740
It's about
canine pepilepsy

255
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:25,842
and how that, you know,
affects dogs.

256
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:28,044
I just hope that
it raises awareness.

257
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:30,980
That is amazing. Is Jemaine
working on it with you?

258
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,348
- Who?
- Jemaine.

259
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,683
Your friend.
The other guy.

260
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,218
- Oh, Jemaine?
- Yeah.

261
00:10:35,286 --> 00:10:37,120
Oh, probably not.

262
00:10:37,187 --> 00:10:38,721
He seems like a really
interesting guy.

263
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:41,691
Well, people think that,
but he's not.

264
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,726
He seems smart too,
with his glasses.

265
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:45,128
- Oh, you like the glasses?
- Yeah.

266
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:47,697
Yeah, they make him look
smart, but he's not smart.

267
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,666
He wears those because
he has weak vision.

268
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,000
- Oh.
- Yeah.

269
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,137
- Hey, speak of the devil.
- As an angel might say.

270
00:10:54,204 --> 00:10:55,972
Jemaine,
you're 15 minutes early.

271
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,007
That's okay. I'm fine
with... I'm just gonna wait.

272
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,977
I mean, I don't mind
is Jemaine joins us.

273
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:04,047
I would prefer... I'd just
feel... I've got 15 minutes left.

274
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,416
Well, we can spend 15 minutes
together another time.

275
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,685
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

276
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,687
Okay, I'll see you
again soon.

277
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:11,988
- Good night.
- Good night.

278
00:11:12,056 --> 00:11:14,190
- See you again soon.
- Okay.

279
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:17,093
See ya, Bret.
I brought you flowers.

280
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:19,696
He seems so sweet.
So nice.

281
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,665
He must have been acting quite
differently to the way he usually is.

282
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,734
He reminds me
of like a little puppy.

283
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:26,102
He's hairy.

284
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,371
Well, his beard,
but I mean, that's cute.

285
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,006
- You like the beard?
- Yeah, I like it.

286
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:32,075
It's very kind of manly.

287
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,244
He reminds me more
of a bearded lady.

288
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,880
Do you guys live together?

289
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:40,316
Sorry, I didn't hear
what you were just saying.

290
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:43,786
I was just thinking about this
poor dog with a chronic condition

291
00:11:43,854 --> 00:11:46,222
that is characterized
by recurrent seizures.

292
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,590
I think about that.

293
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:50,893
I'm writing a song
to try and raise awareness.

294
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,263
Yes, Bret told me.
That's great.

295
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,766
But I'm also
organizing a benefit

296
00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:00,737
to try and raise some money for
these poor prophylactic dogs.

297
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,705
- Epileptic.
- Epileptic.

298
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:03,940
That's... yay.

299
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:05,908
Yay.

300
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:12,215
Yeah, I mean, I've been
there. I have been there.

301
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:15,551
It's never easy when you've got
two chicks into the same dude.

302
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:18,488
I'm talking about two guys
that are into the same girl.

303
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:20,456
Whoa, what the fuck
is that?

304
00:12:20,524 --> 00:12:22,625
I have never been there.

305
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,461
With me it's always
been two or more

306
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:27,497
- girls into the same guy.
- Right.

307
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:30,300
That guy being
the Dave-atronic 5000.

308
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,602
- Yeah, what about what I'm talking about?
- The other way around.

309
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,170
If there's two guys
and one girl?

310
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:35,672
Tell me about it.

311
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:38,241
I had the same situation
once with my friend derek.

312
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:39,609
What did you do?

313
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:43,079
Well, let's just say
derek's no longer with us.

314
00:12:43,147 --> 00:12:45,014
Oh.

315
00:12:45,115 --> 00:12:46,349
- Um...
- right.

316
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:47,917
Did you...

317
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:49,819
no no no no.
He moved to arizona.

318
00:12:49,887 --> 00:12:52,288
Oh, okay.
And what about the girl?

319
00:12:52,356 --> 00:12:54,591
She moved to arizona also.

320
00:12:54,658 --> 00:12:56,693
But I think they moved
to different parts.

321
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:58,995
It's one of
the biggest states.

322
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:01,664
So you've just got to
get the girl, Bret.

323
00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,833
I mean, that's what you were
put on this earth for.

324
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:05,935
- Yeah.
- To precreate.

325
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:09,606
- And what about for me?
- Does she like either one of you more?

326
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:11,708
- I think she likes me.
- Me.

327
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:12,976
Me.

328
00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:17,480
- Bret.
- Hey.

329
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,716
Where you going?

330
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:21,517
Jazzercise.

331
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:23,186
I thought we were gonna
watch the dog show.

332
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:25,121
Can't do it.
Sorry, man.

333
00:13:25,189 --> 00:13:27,824
Seems like an odd time
for jazzercise.

334
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,659
Yeah, it's an impromptu
jazzercise class.

335
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,061
- Doing it by yourself?
- Me and a couple other guys.

336
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:34,397
Just you and a couple of guys
from jazzercise, huh?

337
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:37,233
Getting together and doing
some impromptu jazzercise

338
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:38,635
at night?

339
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:40,169
Yes,
what of it?

340
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:41,404
Nothing.

341
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,706
- You seen my glasses?
- No.

342
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:46,042
I had a shower and I left
them in the sink.

343
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,244
They're probably in the sink.
Have you checked the sink?

344
00:13:48,312 --> 00:13:50,380
- Well, let me just check it.
- I'll see you later, man.

345
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:52,148
<i>Bret, they're not in the sink.</i>

346
00:13:59,223 --> 00:14:02,158
- Bret, whoa.
- Hey, Mel.

347
00:14:02,226 --> 00:14:03,760
Iook at you.

348
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:06,562
Oh wow.

349
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,532
I don't know what's going on,
but can I tell you something?

350
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,267
What?

351
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:13,603
I cannot count how many
times I've laid in bed

352
00:14:13,671 --> 00:14:17,540
wondering what a child of you
and Jemaine might look like,

353
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:21,344
but it looks something like
this in my imagination.

354
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,379
Oh, I don't really
want to know that.

355
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,248
- Can I take your picture?
- No.

356
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:26,516
- See you, Mel.
- Bye.

357
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,551
Oh, whoops.

358
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,020
- Whoops.
- See you, Mel.

359
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:35,191
Mmm, yum.

360
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:37,293
So are you gonna be helping
us with this benefit concert?

361
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:38,695
I'm so excited about it.

362
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:41,297
- I want to, but I'm too busy.
- Oh.

363
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:43,833
I have some good news,
actually.

364
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:47,537
I'm developing a vaccine
for pepileptic dogs.

365
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:50,073
- What?
- I'm developing a vaccine.

366
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,076
I'm sorry, are you
a vet or a doctor?

367
00:14:53,177 --> 00:14:54,844
- No, not really.
- No.

368
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:57,213
But I guess I'm quite
intelligent.

369
00:14:57,247 --> 00:15:00,250
Right, I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

370
00:15:00,317 --> 00:15:02,252
I take it every 30 minutes.

371
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,020
- You've been taking it?
- I take it, yeah.

372
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:06,489
And at the moment...

373
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:10,593
I'm... I'm showing no
symptoms of epilepsy.

374
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:13,396
But you don't...
you never had epilepsy.

375
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:15,465
No, I don't have epilepsy.

376
00:15:15,532 --> 00:15:18,001
But I think that's
because of the vaccine.

377
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:19,102
- Right.
- Yeah.

378
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,904
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

379
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:25,341
Hello? Really?
Thank you.

380
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:27,110
Someone thinks that
they found Charlie.

381
00:15:27,211 --> 00:15:30,346
- Wow, okay.
- Yes, so I have to go meet them.

382
00:15:30,414 --> 00:15:31,848
Well, take that. There's
a little bit left in there.

383
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:33,750
So if you do find him...

384
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:35,752
I can't.

385
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:37,587
My bag is so full.

386
00:15:37,655 --> 00:15:39,355
- Well, um...
- but thanks.

387
00:15:39,423 --> 00:15:40,890
- Okay, bye.
- See you, brahbrah.

388
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,462
Jemaine?

389
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,431
- Oh, Barbara, hey.
- Hi.

390
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:51,167
What are you doing here?
That's so crazy.

391
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:53,236
Someone called and said they
think they found Charlie

392
00:15:53,304 --> 00:15:54,971
and for me
to meet them here.

393
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,873
Oh yes, there was a guy doing
that sort of thing here,

394
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:59,142
but he left.
Would you care for a drink?

395
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,210
Um, you know,

396
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,113
I don't... I don't remember
you having a beard yesterday.

397
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:07,050
Sometimes I grow a beard.

398
00:16:07,117 --> 00:16:08,751
Iooks like it's glued on.

399
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:11,020
Yes, and sometimes
I glue one on.

400
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:12,989
Okay.

401
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:15,491
- When I'm pressed for time.
- Right. Makes sense.

402
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,160
- Yeah.
- Right.

403
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,696
Um, it's getting a little
loose on the... there you go.

404
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:22,832
Um, I should probably go find the
guy who thinks he found Charlie.

405
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,435
- He might be back.
- I should find him.

406
00:16:25,502 --> 00:16:27,437
Thanks.

407
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,909
Excuse me, I'm still waiting
on two waters. Thank you.

408
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:37,847
You ready?
This is take one.

409
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:41,150

Stop guys.

<i>- Can you stop recording there?</i>
- What?

413
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:52,629
Sorry, I can hear a piano
playing there. Who's playing that?

414
00:16:52,696 --> 00:16:53,896
- Bret.
- Yeah.

415
00:16:53,964 --> 00:16:55,932
What, with your feet?
I can't see one.

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,002
Et - no, I've already played it. -
I think there's another guy in there.

417
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:01,371
Is there another guy in there?
Can you have a look around?

418
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:02,972
I think there's someone
playing a piano.

419
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,441
- No, it's a backing track.
- We've already got the piano.

Oh, good.
Yay.

is to harm me ¶

456
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,610
¶ harm me with love ¶

457
00:18:47,678 --> 00:18:51,080
¶ because that is your
weapon of choice ¶

458
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:54,651
¶ and what was that
about last night? ¶

459
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,754
¶ why do we
have to fight? ¶

460
00:18:57,821 --> 00:19:00,757
¶ you've conquered my body
with your kissing ¶

461
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:03,893
¶ your caresses
are your ammunition ¶

462
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:07,063
¶ every time you walk
in through my door ¶

463
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:10,533
¶ you're extending
this one metaphor ¶

464
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,536
¶ you leave me wounded
lying on the floor ¶

465
00:19:13,604 --> 00:19:16,205
¶ I think I've seen
this floor before ¶

466
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,710
¶ love ¶

467
00:19:20,778 --> 00:19:23,179
¶ that's your weapon
of choice ¶

468
00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:27,650
- ¶ love love love ¶
- ¶ love love love ¶

469
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:30,053
¶ that's your weapon
of choice ¶

470
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:34,691
¶ there's a battleship
loaded with emotions ¶

471
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:37,660
¶ crashing onto some
lying ocean ¶

472
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:40,997
<i>¶ and I'm afraid it is</i>
just as I feared ¶

473
00:19:41,065 --> 00:19:44,434
¶ this ocean is made
of my tears ¶

474
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:45,902
¶ love is the weapon ¶

475
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,405
¶ love is the weapon with which
you choose to threaten ¶

476
00:19:49,473 --> 00:19:52,909
¶ love is your
weapon of choice. ¶

477
00:20:00,818 --> 00:20:03,086
- surrender. It's a draw.
- Hi, guys.

478
00:20:03,153 --> 00:20:04,887
- Hey. Oh, hey.
- Hi.

479
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,123
<i>- Hey.</i>
- How are you, Barbara?

480
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:09,158
I'm good.
Should I come back?

481
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:12,495
- No.
- It's fine. We're just finishing up, actually.

482
00:20:12,563 --> 00:20:15,098
I found the perfect location
for your canine epilepsy benefit.

483
00:20:15,165 --> 00:20:17,767
- Yay. Yay.
- Yay!

484
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:30,413
- Oh, hey, Barbara.
- Hi.

485
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,548
- Hey, brahbrah.
- Barbara.

486
00:20:32,616 --> 00:20:34,350
Iook.
Iook who's here.

487
00:20:34,418 --> 00:20:35,985
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

488
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:38,855
All because of your concert.
You guys, thank you so much.

489
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:40,857
It's amazing
because it was my idea.

490
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:42,792
Hey, I've got a new
batch of the vaccine.

491
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,795
- It's got toffee in it.
- Thank you, though.

492
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:48,431
- That doesn't sound very medical.
- You liked it.

493
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:51,634
- He must have seen all the posters.
- Oh my God, he likes me.

494
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:53,469
Oh, he likes me.

495
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:55,505
- Oh, I can tell he's happy.
- Miss?

496
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:57,740
- Yeah?
- That's my dog.

497
00:20:57,808 --> 00:21:00,209
I think you're mistaken.

498
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:02,178
- It's her dog.
- This is Charlie.

499
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:04,881
It's my dog mocha. See there
on the tag? It says mocha.

500
00:21:04,949 --> 00:21:08,251
Maybe that isn't Charlie.
He's a different color.

501
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,954
Actually, he does look like
a different breed, doesn't he?

502
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,256
Yeah, he's
a different breed.

503
00:21:13,324 --> 00:21:14,624
I was wondering that.
He doesn't look like Charlie.

504
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:16,926
Different size.

505
00:21:16,994 --> 00:21:20,430
- Can I have my dog?
- Yes.

506
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:25,201
Mocha, come.

507
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:27,203
Come, mocha.

508
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:30,807
I'm so embarrassed.
Oh my gosh.

509
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:34,277
- No, it's all right.
- He's just a real stickler, that guy.

510
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:37,814
- Charlie will show up.
- Yeah, he'll come.

511
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,949
- He'll come and find you.
- Bret, get out.

512
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:43,486
- Thanks.
- Sorry, Jemaine's got his creepy hand on your shoulder.

513
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:46,155
- Thanks, guys.
- Bret, you're crowding her.

514
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:50,226
Thank you.

515
00:21:50,294 --> 00:21:53,029
It's great to be here. I'd
like to dedicate this song to

516
00:21:53,097 --> 00:21:54,897
- all the dogs with pepilepsy.
- Bret, your speech is boring.

517
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:57,467
This song is dedicated
to epileptic dogs.

518
00:21:57,534 --> 00:22:00,169
- I love dogs.
- I love dogs with epilepsy.

519
00:22:01,772 --> 00:22:06,442
¶ think about
the epileptic dogs ¶

520
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,350
¶ not all the puppies
are born so lucky ¶

521
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:18,755
¶ somewhere there's
a golden retriever ¶

522
00:22:18,822 --> 00:22:21,691
¶ who's having a seizure ¶

523
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:24,961
¶ somewhere there's
a pup seizing up ¶

524
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:29,332
¶ and there's a labrador
who's shaking on the floor ¶

525
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,937
¶ think about
the epileptic dogs ¶

526
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:38,641
¶ send them some money ¶

527
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:41,878
¶ to stop these dogs
from acting funny ¶

528
00:22:43,881 --> 00:22:47,884
¶ send a check in the letter
to make a setter feel better ¶

529
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:52,722
¶ come on, make a donation ¶

530
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,091
¶ and save
a shaky dalmatian ¶

531
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,761
¶ this is the remix ¶

532
00:22:58,796 --> 00:23:00,296
¶ ep-ilep-ep-ep-leptic ¶

533
00:23:00,364 --> 00:23:03,533
¶ ep-ilep-ep-ep-leptic,
ep-ilep-ep-ep-leptic ¶

534
00:23:03,601 --> 00:23:06,569
¶ ep-ilep-ep-ep-leptic... ¶

535
00:23:10,007 --> 00:23:12,475
so what did you
think, Murray?

536
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:13,710
How do you
think it went?

537
00:23:13,777 --> 00:23:16,479
Oh, well, it was good,
wasn't it?

538
00:23:16,547 --> 00:23:18,581
- Do you think so?
- Yeah, it was different.

539
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:21,951
- Barbara.
- Hey, guys.

540
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,254
It didn't go
perfectly, but...

541
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:26,756
it was a tragedy.

542
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:30,293
Well, it raised awars
of canine pepilepsy.

543
00:23:30,361 --> 00:23:33,363
The, um, strobe lights gave
all of the dogs seizures.

544
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,865
- Not all of them.
- Well, the epileptic ones.

545
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:38,768
- Yeah, all of those ones.
- I thought they were dancing.

546
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:41,638
- No, those were fits.
- Even the golden doodle?

547
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:43,306
- Yes.
- The shih-tzu was dancing.

548
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,341
- No, he passed away.
- Dogs can't dance, Bret.

549
00:23:45,409 --> 00:23:47,310
That's a shame, 'cause we
really put a lot of work into it.

550
00:23:47,378 --> 00:23:50,446
Shame to know it was
because of our song.

551
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:52,649
All right, stop it, guys. I
can see what's happening here.

552
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:55,118
<i>- Sorry, Barbara.</i>
- What's going on?

553
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,587
You see, my two lads here
both seem to fancy you.

554
00:23:57,655 --> 00:24:00,690
Okay? I'm sorry,
but there it is.

555
00:24:00,758 --> 00:24:03,893
No, listen. Barbara, if you
could choose one of them, please,

556
00:24:03,961 --> 00:24:05,595
that you like the most
and then take them

557
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:07,697
<i>on a nice date somewhere,</i>
that would be good.

558
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:10,033
On the other hand, if you like
me, that's a different story.

559
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,535
- So embarrassing.
- Right, I've got to go.

560
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:14,704
- And no dueling.
- How are we...

561
00:24:14,805 --> 00:24:17,707
no dueling, and that's
the final word on that.

562
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:19,842
- Excuse me, Barbara.
- Yes, of course.

563
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:21,911
See you later, Murray.

564
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:24,280
Oh, that guy.

565
00:24:24,348 --> 00:24:27,417
- Sorry about him.
- But basically what he said.

566
00:24:27,484 --> 00:24:29,552
We like you.

567
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,554
I like you guys too.
What's the problem?

568
00:24:31,622 --> 00:24:33,389
We like you like you.

569
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:35,625
- We love you.
- What?

570
00:24:35,693 --> 00:24:38,561
- In love with you.
- I love you and he loves you.

571
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:41,464
I'm sorry, I thought
you guys were gay.

572
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:43,232
- Gay?
- Yeah.

573
00:24:43,334 --> 00:24:45,501
- No, we're not gay.
- Hey, guys.

574
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:47,337
- Hey, Mel.
- Hello.

575
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:49,739
I made a mock-up
family portrait

576
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:51,240
of what you two
would look like

577
00:24:51,308 --> 00:24:54,377
and if you had a baby
what the baby would look like

578
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:57,347
- coming out of you guys.
- Kind of cute.

579
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,482
- Thanks, Mel.
- Yeah.

580
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,652
She's made a little photo
of us as a couple.

581
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,355
Jemaine's the dad, I guess, and
I've given birth to this little baby.

582
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:09,359
You know, sorry. What
made you think we were gay?

583
00:25:09,426 --> 00:25:11,894
I'm sorry. If I would have known
that you guys were both interested

584
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:13,496
I mean, I probably
wouldn't have, you know...

585
00:25:13,564 --> 00:25:15,999
played havoc with our friendship?

586
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:18,935
No, I was gonna say spent equal
amounts of time with Jemaine.

587
00:25:19,003 --> 00:25:20,937
- Sorry.
- What?

588
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:23,673
Oh.

589
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:26,609
Truthfully, I'm interested
in Bret if he's straight.

590
00:25:26,677 --> 00:25:28,845
- Yeah.
- That's Bret there.

591
00:25:28,912 --> 00:25:30,813
- Yeah, this one.
- Cool.

592
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:33,349
- Yeah yeah, fully straight.
- Okay.

593
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:34,851
Do you want to maybe
go get some coffee?

594
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,853
- I'd love to.
- I meant Bret.

595
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:38,187
- Oh, yes.
- Could Jemaine come?

596
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:41,424
- Maybe another time.
- But, Barbara, I thought...

597
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:44,594
- my name is brahbrah.
- Brahbrah?

598
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,163
Uh-huh.
B- r-a-h-

599
00:25:47,231 --> 00:25:49,732
- b-r-a-h.
- Braha?

600
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,734
- Brahbrah.
- Told you it was brahbrah.

601
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:53,970
Oh.
Well, that's...

602
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:57,140
- sorry, Jemaine.
- See you later, Bret and brahbrah.

603
00:25:57,241 --> 00:26:00,310
Yes, thank you.

604
00:26:00,377 --> 00:26:03,813
So, brahbrah, how long
