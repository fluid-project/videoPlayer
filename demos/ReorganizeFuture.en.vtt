00:00:01.77 --> 00:00:04.03
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,

2
00:00:04.03 --> 00:00:05.99
Catch a tiger by the toe

3
00:00:05.99 --> 00:00:08.05
If he hollers let him go

4
00:00:08.05 --> 00:00:10.96
Eeny, meeny, miny moe.

5
00:00:12.70 --> 00:00:14.64
I'm Jutta Treviranus

6
00:00:14.64 --> 00:00:16.04
and I've come to wonder

7
00:00:16.04 --> 00:00:18.38
whether we have a chance to reorganize our future.

8
00:00:18.38 --> 00:00:23.23
David Kelley says that the future of design is human centred.

9
00:00:23.23 --> 00:00:25.51
Most experts agree.

10
00:00:25.51 --> 00:00:29.02
That leaves the question - which human?

11
00:00:29.02 --> 00:00:32.46
An inevitable human condition is diversity.

12
00:00:32.46 --> 00:00:34.70
There's no typical human,

13
00:00:34.70 --> 00:00:37.33
even clones and identical twins are not the same.

14
00:00:37.33 --> 00:00:40.42
We differ from one to the next,

15
00:00:40.42 --> 00:00:43.54
but also from one moment to the next,

16
00:00:43.54 --> 00:00:46.84
from one context to the next.

17
00:00:46.84 --> 00:00:49.91
But diversity and difference become overwhelming

18
00:00:49.91 --> 00:00:52.94
and we develop strategies to deal with this diversity.

19
00:00:52.94 --> 00:00:55.56
We try to make things simpler,

20
00:00:55.60 --> 00:00:57.50
less complex, less chaotic

21
00:00:57.50 --> 00:01:00.00
Another part of the human condition is that

22
00:01:00.00 --> 00:01:03.18
we try to find commonality and connections.

23
00:01:03.20 --> 00:01:09.53
We form groups informal and formal with implicit and explicit criteria.

24
00:01:09.55 --> 00:01:13.97
We organize, we create categories, we filter, we label.

25
00:01:13.97 --> 00:01:19.67
At our most insecure and overwhelmed we divide in two, we create binaries:

26
00:01:19.67 --> 00:01:21.86
male, female

27
00:01:21.86 --> 00:01:24.21
disabled, normal

28
00:01:24.21 --> 00:01:27.03
left, right

29
00:01:27.03 --> 00:01:29.57
us, them.

30
00:01:29.57 --> 00:01:34.98
This all results in issues of who belongs and who is excluded.

31
00:01:34.98 --> 00:01:37.53
Membership in groups can be self assigned,

32
00:01:37.53 --> 00:01:40.46
may be imposed, may even be policed.

33
00:01:40.46 --> 00:01:44.17
Groups are used to assert or assign privileges and powers.

34
00:01:44.17 --> 00:01:46.92
We use groups to judge

35
00:01:46.92 --> 00:01:49.22
values get assigned to groups

36
00:01:49.22 --> 00:01:51.88
often characteristics that have nothing to do with

37
00:01:51.88 --> 00:01:53.35
the original founding properties of groups

38
00:01:53.35 --> 00:01:55.98
are generalized to all individuals in the group.

39
00:01:55.98 --> 00:02:00.07
Sometimes, people who are in an imposed group

40
00:02:00.07 --> 00:02:02.00
take ownership of the group and reform

41
00:02:02.00 --> 00:02:04.42
the classifications and values from within.

42
00:02:04.42 --> 00:02:08.44
Occasionally, someone has the audacity

43
00:02:08.44 --> 00:02:11.00
to break out of the category we have put her in

44
00:02:11.00 --> 00:02:16.90
but to preserve our category, we may dismiss her as an anomaly.

45
00:02:16.90 --> 00:02:20.03
Some groups are more fluid while others are more fixed.

46
00:02:20.03 --> 00:02:23.56
We not only form groups, but groups of groups

47
00:02:23.56 --> 00:02:25.66
and groups, of groups, of groups.

48
00:02:25.66 --> 00:02:29.09
Membership in one group can grant us membership in other groups.

49
00:02:29.09 --> 00:02:33.03
But despite all this, we are diverse,

50
00:02:33.03 --> 00:02:34.85
we are complex,

51
00:02:34.85 --> 00:02:36.45
we are chaotic.

52
00:02:36.45 --> 00:02:38.81
Individually we're different

53
00:02:38.81 --> 00:02:40.44
over time, in different contexts,

54
00:02:40.44 --> 00:02:42.35
in different roles, in different groups.

55
00:02:42.35 --> 00:02:45.42
We need to assert our uniqueness,

56
00:02:45.42 --> 00:02:47.86
we need to form and refine our identity.

57
00:02:47.86 --> 00:02:50.91
We struggle with the identity imposed on us.

58
00:02:50.91 --> 00:02:56.36
Generally, people do not fit easily into assigned categories

59
00:02:56.36 --> 00:02:58.98
and yet we persist in assigning them.

60
00:02:58.98 --> 00:03:02.63
And then, something new comes along

61
00:03:02.63 --> 00:03:05.41
and shakes up our groups, our categories and our rules,

62
00:03:05.41 --> 00:03:08.26
and we need to adjust, rebuild and rethink.

63
00:03:08.26 --> 00:03:12.53
Something like, networks and digital stuff.

64
00:03:12.53 --> 00:03:15.47
This new digital and connected world

65
00:03:15.47 --> 00:03:17.87
puts into question how we group things

66
00:03:17.87 --> 00:03:20.75
and challenges our excuses for leaving people out.

67
00:03:20.75 --> 00:03:25.46
The digital changes our view of time, space and distance

68
00:03:25.46 --> 00:03:31.08
and by extension our view of design, what is possible and what things cost.

69
00:03:31.08 --> 00:03:36.04
Digital things are plastic, mutable, malleable and adaptable.

70
00:03:36.04 --> 00:03:39.50
Before, not everyone could fit,

71
00:03:39.50 --> 00:03:42.16
allowing someone in meant someone else was left out.

72
00:03:42.16 --> 00:03:46.06
In the digital, room is very stretchy.

73
00:03:46.06 --> 00:03:49.76
Before, what we created could not fit everyone

74
00:03:49.76 --> 00:03:51.77
so we made it fit the largest group.

75
00:03:51.77 --> 00:03:54.53
We made it for the group called average or typical

76
00:03:54.53 --> 00:03:58.26
this left out everyone not average or typical.

77
00:03:58.26 --> 00:04:03.39
In the digital reality the things we make can reconfigure, adapt

78
00:04:03.39 --> 00:04:06.27
and take a form that is best for each individual.

79
00:04:06.27 --> 00:04:11.90
In the solid world, each copy cost almost the same as the original.

80
00:04:11.90 --> 00:04:14.35
Consumption actually consumed.

81
00:04:14.35 --> 00:04:18.56
In the digital world, we can copy almost without cost.

82
00:04:18.56 --> 00:04:21.00
Consumption no longer consumes.

83
00:04:21.00 --> 00:04:24.52
Before, it took a great deal of time and effort

84
00:04:24.52 --> 00:04:27.23
to deliver things, especially to people far away.

85
00:04:27.23 --> 00:04:30.93
Now it is as easy to deliver things around the world

86
00:04:30.93 --> 00:04:33.13
as it is to deliver things next door.

87
00:04:33.13 --> 00:04:36.85
Before, if we didn't place things in a fixed spot

88
00:04:36.85 --> 00:04:39.53
we would have a hard time finding them again.

89
00:04:39.53 --> 00:04:43.63
Now we can place them anywhere on the network and

90
00:04:43.63 --> 00:04:46.26
retrieve them anywhere on the network.

91
00:04:46.26 --> 00:04:50.13
Before, we needed to label things unambiguously and simply

92
00:04:50.13 --> 00:04:52.80
so we could recognize them and know what to do with them.

93
00:04:52.80 --> 00:04:56.44
Now we can see a description of each person or thing

94
00:04:56.44 --> 00:04:59.02
that is useful and relevant to our purpose.

95
00:04:59.02 --> 00:05:03.01
And by the way, we have learned that

96
00:05:03.01 --> 00:05:06.36
inclusion and equality are good for all of us.

97
00:05:06.36 --> 00:05:09.35
We are all healthier, wealthier and wiser

98
00:05:09.35 --> 00:05:12.19
when our society is inclusive and equal.

99
00:05:12.19 --> 00:05:15.36
We've also discovered that diverse groups

100
00:05:15.36 --> 00:05:18.93
are more innovative and creative, and better at planning and predicting.

101
00:05:18.93 --> 00:05:23.73
We've experimented with new organization like

102
00:05:23.73 --> 00:05:26.33
most popular, to be ignored

103
00:05:26.33 --> 00:05:28.69
friend, not friend.

104
00:05:28.69 --> 00:05:31.03
But we can do better.

105
00:05:31.03 --> 00:05:33.26
We can afford to be generous in our design,

106
00:05:33.26 --> 00:05:35.39
we have fewer excuses to exclude.

107
00:05:35.39 --> 00:05:37.56
We can be true to our diversity.

108
00:05:37.56 --> 00:05:43.06
Perhaps now, we can find a way to make room for us all.
