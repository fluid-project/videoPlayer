An interview with Dr. Ross MacPhee

3
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:08.082
Curator and Researcher at the American Museum of Natural History

4
00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:13.074
What adaptations do mammals have in order to survive at the poles?

5
00:00:13.074 --> 00:00:16.057
We can think of a couple of important ways in which adaptation has

6
00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:21.054
made it possible for mammals to live in polar regions.

7
00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.038
Insulation is the big deal, this is either

8
00:00:24.038 --> 00:00:29.081
in the form of what kind of fur or hair that the body has

9
00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:31.095
or the amount of blubber

10
00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:35.061
or a very efficient circulatory system, high basic metabolism

11
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:41.019
All of these features have in common the idea that you need to keep the animal warm

12
00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.086
Marine mammals in fact have less of a problem than you might think in a way

13
00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:48.029
because as long as the water is water, it's not frozen

14
00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:51.017
and it's going to be at 32 degrees or above.

15
00:00:51.017 --> 00:00:57.021
So they're able in fact to do quite well with a few inches of blubber

16
00:00:57.021 --> 00:01:02.097
and the kind of fur patterning that is very high in its R value

17
00:01:02.097 --> 00:01:04.055
so you don't lose a lot of heat.

18
00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:06.073
On land it's a different deal

19
00:01:06.073 --> 00:01:09.065
there you have extreme temperature excursions

20
00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:13.004
and that is worry if you are any kind of mammal

21
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:15.069
because you're not going to be adapted to the very coldest conditions

22
00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:18.071
and there's other kinds of adaptations that will have to come in here.

23
00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:20.094
One of the significant ones is hibernation.

24
00:01:20.094 --> 00:01:27.021
There's a number of arctic mammals both on the carnivore side and the non-carnivore side

25
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:31.081
that go in for various kinds of either true deep sleep

26
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:35.001
which is characteristic of hibernation or at least estivation

27
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:37.098
which is where they really reduce their activities.

28
00:01:37.098 --> 00:01:40.063
Let's take a look at bears, for example.

29
00:01:40.063 --> 00:01:45.065
Female polar bears give birth while they're hibernating.

30
00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:48.094
They dig out a hole in the snow, a cave in the snow and

31
00:01:48.094 --> 00:01:51.042
that's where they stay over the winter months and

32
00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:55.002
pups are actually born while the mother is still hibernating.

33
00:01:55.002 --> 00:02:00.037
And this permits her to provide a very warm kind of enclosure

34
00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:03.094
for the cubs as they are developing outside of her body

35
00:02:03.094 --> 00:02:10.086
and also reduces the need for her to part from them during the very early stages of their development.

36
00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:16.033
For small mammals, think of rodents, it's different again.

37
00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:19.087
Most of them actually stay active the entire winter

38
00:02:19.087 --> 00:02:23.031
and if you go up into arctic regions just after the snow melts

39
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:26.014
you can see their little runways everywhere where they've been

40
00:02:26.014 --> 00:02:29.099
actually going under the snow and feeding on grass shoots or roots

41
00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.036
anything that's preserved there for them.
