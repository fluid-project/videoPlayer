An interview with Dr. Ross MacPhee, curator and researcher at the American Museum of Natural History.

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.000
What is a mammal?

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.050
Mammals are a group of vertebrates

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.000
that is to say, animals with backbones

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
who are distinguished by having four legs or

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.093
four appendages that are like legs

8
00:00:24.093 --> 00:00:30.016
and whose young develop within a complicated series of birth membranes.

9
00:00:30.016 --> 00:00:36.033
By contrast, fish are vertebrates, but true fish lack four appendages

10
00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.091
so they're not tetrapod as we call them

11
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:43.033
and animals like amphibians who do have four legs

12
00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:48.020
and do have backbones are not members of that particular group

13
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.064
because they don't have these complicated birth membranes.

14
00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:58.014
We are distinguished from all other vertebrates by that general set of features.

15
00:00:58.014 --> 00:01:01.083
More specifically, we're the only group that has the combination

16
00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:08.000
of hair, mother's milk and three tiny bones in the middle ear

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.083
that are responsible for conducting sound from the outside

18
00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:15.050
to where it can be interpreted in the brain.
