An interview with Dr. Ross MacPhee Curator and Researcher at the American Museum of Natural History

3
00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:13.065
What mammals live in the polar regions?

4
00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:16.062
So in terms of characteristically arctic mammals

5
00:00:16.062 --> 00:00:19.041
what we can think of are first of all the large herbivores

6
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:22.038
these would be musk oxen, and caribou

7
00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:27.000
some of the major carnivores including polar bear, arctic fox

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.041
and then a host of other mostly smaller mammals

9
00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:35.083
arctic hare comes to mind and several of the other rodent groups

10
00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:39.010
are also represented in the arctic.

11
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.074
We also should think about sea mammals in this regard

12
00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:45.037
because the sea mammals in fact in arctic waters are very diverse

13
00:00:45.037 --> 00:00:50.057
in additions to large whales, both toothed whales and baleen or filter feeding whales

14
00:00:50.057 --> 00:00:56.051
we've got a whole host of smaller whales including porpoises and orcas

15
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:59.050
and then there's the seal group.

16
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.090
We've got the seals that live all the time in arctic waters

17
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.038
like walruses and sea lions and

18
00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:12.077
also other kinds of members of the same group like ribbon seals.

19
00:01:12.077 --> 00:01:16.090
Now these different groups of course, all have different feeding regimes.

20
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.017
So in the case of seals we think of them as basically being carnivores.

21
00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:27.083
But for walruses for example they actually feed almost exclusively on shellfish

22
00:01:27.083 --> 00:01:32.018
which they take into their mouths and actually suck out the contents.

23
00:01:32.018 --> 00:01:34.092
So that's a very specialized kind of adaptive regime

24
00:01:34.092 --> 00:01:41.016
that wouldn't be characteristic for example of a ribbon seal which simply goes after fish.
