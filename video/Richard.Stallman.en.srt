Moderator: Richard, please

1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,000
Richard: Oh, it stopped showing the time

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I just stroke it a little bit

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't use these handheld computers

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
because they have non-free
software in them

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Um, well, some of you might be wondering
why I have aluminium foil around my badge

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's because there is an
RFID in the badge

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
An RFID is a tracking device.
If you have an RFID on you

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
it can be tracked at any time,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
so they are a terrible threat
to privacy rights

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and because of that
I am fighting back

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I have got aluminium foil here 

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
if you want to shield

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
your RFID so that it
can't be tracked

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
then come and get some
when the panel is over.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
But I have been fighting
for freedom

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
for a long time. Twenty-two years
ago now

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I announced the beginning
of the Free Software movement,

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
a social movement for freedom
for computer users

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
specifically, the freedom to cooperate

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and the freedom to control 
your own computer

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
the freedom for users to work
together

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
in a community controlling the
software that they use.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This was impossible in 1983

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
because computers don't do
anything without an operating system

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
it's just a piece of
metal and sillicon

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that is totally useless

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
but all the operating systems
22 years ago

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
were proprietary software,

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
software that keeps users
divided and helpless.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So,... I was determined not to have
to live that way in using computers

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't want to be helpless

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and I don't want to be
forbidden to share with you

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So I decided I would do something
about it

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What can I do?

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I had no political party behind me

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I couldn't expect to convince
governments or corporations

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to change any of their policies.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
but I did know how to write software

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
so I said: I'm gonna develop

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
another operating system and, with 
the help of

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
whoever will join in

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and together we will make it
free software

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
we will respect your freedom

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and you will be able then
to use computers

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
in freedom with this operating system

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But what does this freedom mean?

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There are 4 essential freedoms

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
that make the definition of free
software

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and they are: Freedom Zero

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the freedom to run the program 
however you wish

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Freedom 1, the freedom to help yourself

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
that's the freedom to study the source code

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
and change it to do what you wish

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
then there is Freedom 2

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
the freedom to help your neighbour

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that's the freedom to copy the program

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and distribute the copies to others
when you wish

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and Freedom 3 is the freedom to help your
community

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
that's the freedom to publish or
distribute 

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
a modified version when you wish

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
With all four freedoms the
program is free software

62
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
but these freedoms should not
be strange to you

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
at least not if you cook

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
because people who cook enjoy the same
four freedoms

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
in using recipes

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
the freedom to cook the recipe when you want

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
that's Freedom Zero

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the freedom to study the ingredients 

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
and how it's done an then change it

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
that is freedom one. Cooks frequently
change recipes

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and then the freedom to copy it

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and give copies to your friends,
that's Freedom 2

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and then there is..., Freedom 3 is less frequently exercised

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
because it is more work,

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
but if you cook your version of the recipe

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
for a dinner with your friends

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and a friend says: "That was great! Could I have the recipe?"

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
you can write down your version of the recipe

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and make a copy for your friend

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The same four freedoms!

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And this is no coincidence!

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
because programs like recipes

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
are works that you use for practical work

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you use them to do something

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and when you use a work to do something

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
if you are not in control of it
you are not in control of your life

87
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and if you cannot share with other people

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
you are forbidden to be a part of a community

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Imagine how angry everyone who cooks would be

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
if someday the government says:

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
From now on if you share or change a recipe,

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
we are gonna call you a pirate!

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
We are gonna compare you to 
people who attack ships!

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And we are gonna put you
in prison for years

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
because that's forbidden cooperation

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Imagine the angers that there would be!

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That anger is at the basis of the
Free Software movement, too.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
we want to have freedom in using our computers

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So we developed the GNU operating system

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
throughout the 1980s,

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and in 1992 the last missing piece
was put in place

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:60,000
That last missing piece is a
kernel called Linux

103
00:04:60,000 --> 00:05:04,000
so Linux is not an operating system, it's 
one essential component

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
of a system which is the GNU system plus Linux

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the GNU / Linux system

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and that system now is used on 
tens of millions of computers

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Jon Hall estimated a 100 million
a year or two ago

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
no one really knows, because, you see,
we are all free,

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
nobody can keep track of what we are doing,
thats part

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
of the freedom that nobody knows
exactly what is going on,

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
because you don't have to tell anybody

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So, today it's possible to use a
computer in freedom

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
but that doesn't mean freedom
is safe forever

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Freedom is never safe forever!

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There's always the danger that you get
somebody like a George Bush who wants

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
to take it away!

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Even in the countries like the US which says

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
freedom is what we are all about

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that can be turned into mere
lip-service

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:60,000
freedoms can be crushed

121
00:05:60,000 --> 00:06:03,000
so, for people to have freedom,

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
we have to be prepared to defend freedom

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and in order to defend our freedom

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
we have to recognize what it means

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,500
that's the first step

126
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
so that's why I'm here today

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
talking to you about free software

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and the freedoms that it represents

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
freedoms for you

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
because that way you will know
what your freedom means

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and then, maybe, next year

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
or next decade you will help
us defend these freedoms

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
and they may continue

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
many people focus on encouraging

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
more users to switch to free software

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
well, that's a useful thing to do

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
but that alone is not going

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
to bring us to freedoms that endure

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
if we gave everybody in the world
free software today

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
but we would fail to teach them

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
about the four freedoms

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
then 5 years from now: 

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Would they still have free software?

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Probably not!

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Because if they don't recognize
their freedoms

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
they will let their freedoms fall

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
they will let freedom slip 
through their fingers

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
because they won't bother to 
close their hands

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
if they don't know why

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
so along with developing free software

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
along with distributing it, teaching
people to use it

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
encouraging people to try it and switch to it

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
we have to be constantly teaching the same people

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
why it matters

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
that it's not just about how 
we get powerful convenient

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
software and how to get it as cheap
as possible

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
it's about how you can live in freedom

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and be a good neighbour

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So, how does this relate to the 
issues of development?

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is free software better
for development?

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, that's an understatement.

162
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Free software is the only software

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
whose use constitutes development

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
because the use of a non-free program

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
is not development, it's electronic
colonization

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What does it mean if your society

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
increases the use of non-free software?

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
well, that's software that nobody

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
in your city can fix, unless you 

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
happen to live just in the 
right place in the world

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
nobody in your city is 
in a position

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
to understand it

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
maintain it, adapt it

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
extend it, or do anything with it

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
it's just like the old colonial system

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
where the colonial power had all the industry

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
they made all the technology

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and the people in the colony

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
they just had to buy it

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and they weren't supposed to understand anything
or make anything

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
they hardly even knew how to fix it -

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
imagine if you were buying cars

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and they came from the US

184
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and anytime they broke you had
to ship them back to the US

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
because it is a secret 

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
how they work inside

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and nobody in your country is allowed

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
to learn how to fix them

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
that's what proprietary software
is like

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
so this is not sustainable development

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
it's not appropriate technology

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
this is a technology of dependence

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and dependence is exactly what 

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
that system is all about

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
it's keeping people helpless

196
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
another feature of the old colonial
system was

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
divide and rule

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
set people against each other

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
don't allow them to cooperate

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
because that makes it easier

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
to keep all of them in subjection

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
now, divide - dividing people

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
and subjugating them

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
it's not just a minor side-aspect

205
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
of proprietary software

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
it's what makes it proprietary software

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
the license says you are
forbidden to share it with anyone

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and you can't get the source code

209
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
so you can't know what's inside it

210
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
so you can't control it
-divide it and subjugate it

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
that's what the nature of 
proprietary software is

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
so of course the system comes out

213
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
looking like the colonial system

214
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
another feature you might remember

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
from the colonial system was

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
that the colonial power 

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
would recruit a local elite

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
a few local people who would,

219
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
like, maybe, the nobles

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
or whoever, or like 

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
on tribe against another

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
or they would create tribes

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
if there weren't tribes

224
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
so that they could massacre 

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
each other decades later

226
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and so the local elite

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
they would get certain privileges

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and in return they would help

229
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
keep everybody else down

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
well, you can see that today

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
some proprietary software companies

232
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
actively recruit local elites

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
they set up a software development center

234
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
in your country, and the people 

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
who work there are part of
the local elite

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
or they do some favor either

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
for politicans secretly

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
or for the government openly

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
but it doesn't make any difference which one,

240
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
in either way they are buying
influence in the government

241
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
converting that government

242
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
from a sovereign state

243
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
into their local overseer

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
of their empire whose job is to make sure

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
everybody else becomes dependent 

246
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
on the same non-free software

247
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
they say to schools:

248
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
we will help you by giving you these
gratis copies

249
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
of our non-free software

250
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
so that you can turn your students

251
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
into addicts of our software

252
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Why do I use the term addicts?

253
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
because they develop a dependency

254
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
on this software, and then after 
they graduate

255
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you can be sure they are not

256
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
gonna be offered these gratis copies anymore

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
because it's only the first dose that's gratis

258
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
once you are addicted

259
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
then you are supposed to pay

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
and then also of course the companies

261
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
that these graduates work for

262
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
those companies are not gonna be offered
gratis copies

263
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
so what essentially, what these software companies

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
they are recruiting the schools

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
into agents to lead people into

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
permanent life-long dependency

267
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
These are the things that

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the Open Source movement usually
doesn't talk about

269
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
that's why I don't support Open Source

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Open Source is a way of promoting

271
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
software that usually is free

272
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
but without mentioning these ideals

273
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
these are issues of freedom

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
they are left in the background

275
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Open Source people usually talk

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
only about practical values

277
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
you know, how do you get powerful

278
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
convenient software

279
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and how much will it cost

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
well, free software probably allows 
you to save money, too

281
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
if you are not being forced to pay
for permission 

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
so use it, you can probably save money

283
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
but I think that's a secondary issue

284
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
even in poor countries freedom is important

285
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
we should never start saying:

286
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh, they are so poor, 

287
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
freedom for them doesn't matter

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
all they need is some bread and circusses

289
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
- which they had here once upon a time

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and then they shouldn't even think 
about being free

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I think freedom is important

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
in every country, in every society

293
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
whether it's rich or poor

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
nonetheless, people who support Open Source

295
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
often contribute to extending

296
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
the free software community

297
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
many of them develop free software

298
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
those are useful contributions

299
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I am not saying that what they do is bad

300
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I am saying that by itself, it is not enough!

301
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
because it's weak, you see,
when you say the goal

302
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
is to have powerful, reliable, convenient 
software and get it cheap

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
then it becomes possible

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
for the representatives of 
proprietary software

305
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
to say: well, we claim, we deliver you 

306
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:60,000
more powerful reliable software

307
00:13:60,000 --> 00:14:03,000
we claim that our total cost of 
ownership will be cheaper

308
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and I think it's usually bullshit

309
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
when Microsoft says that it's 
based on distorted facts

310
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
but, it's weak

311
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
but when we say the goal 
is to live in freedom

312
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
and to be allowed to cooperate with 
other people in a community

313
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
they can't say they are going 
to offer us more of that cheaper

314
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
because they don't offer that at all

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
they are not even competing with us

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
they are out of the running

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
once you decide you want to live in freedom

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
they are out of the running

319
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
so - we are trying to help you

320
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
reach freedom in a community

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
they are trying to subjugate you

322
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But they say they will get you
there faster!

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
And maybe they would.

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I guess I will yield the rest of my time

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
because I have said what I need to say.

326
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Moderator: This is a remarkable,

327
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
this is one of the most remarkable
moments in my life

328
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I think that we should all be cherished
to be here today

329
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
because this is the first time history,
and it's recorded history

330
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
that Richard Stallman has ended a speech early

331
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
RMS: You are wrong, I did it a few weeks 
ago, too!

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
- Applause -

333
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Moderator: I don't know what to say

334
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But I am about to try

335
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Perens: Ken, Ken is really happy because
his job

336
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
was a lot easier than he thought 
it would be
